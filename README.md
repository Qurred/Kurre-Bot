# Kurre-Bot
![Kurre-bot](kapy.png)
A test to try Discord.js and also to have some fun with frinds.
Currently bot doesn't have much functionality, but with time I will add features.

Things to do:
- Clean up the code
  - Move commands to "addons"-folder to make things prettier
- Give users a possibility to add their Osu! account id to Kurre-bot's database
  - Data from this id will be used for example when tracking multiplayer much between Guild Members
- Add package.json to help out with init
- Add atleast language support for 2 (two) languages
  - Finnish and English
