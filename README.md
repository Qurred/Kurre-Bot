# Kurre-Bot
![Kurre-bot](kapy.png)
A test to try Discord.js and also to have some fun with frinds.
Currently bot doesn't have much functionality, but with time I will add features.
Kurre-bot is currently able to save used data to multiple different JSON files.



Things to do:
- Clean up the code
- Refactor code
    - add more stuff to the client variable
